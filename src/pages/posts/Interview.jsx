        <h2>How To Prepare For A Job Interview, By Ms. Anukriti Sharma</h2>
        <hr />

        <img src={im1} alt="" srcset="" />
        <h4>What is a job interview? </h4>
        <p>
          The term interview implies a question and answer session between a
          company representative/panel of company representatives and the job
          seeker. This is a crucial moment, a life-changing moment because the
          outcome of the interview will determine whether or not the job
          applicant gets hired. Depending on the competition for the position,
          there may be one or several interviews. As a result, it is critical
          that you are well-prepared for each and every interview that you will
          conduct in the future.
          <br />
          <br />
          Why is it important to know some etiquette rules in preparation for a
          job interview?
          <br />
          <br />
          Primarily, knowing basic standards of behavior can assist you in
          representing the best version of yourself when you’re nervously
          approaching a room full of people who are there to judge you.
          <br />
          <br />
          You’re naturally nervous when you walk into that room, so you’re
          thinking about what you’re going to say and how you’re going to convey
          your credentials and accomplishments. Furthermore, having to think
          about how to behave, and what to do and say is too much. When you
          understand the right etiquette rules, you will have less tension and
          will be able to focus on how to promote your qualifications and
          accomplishments.
          <br />
          <br />
          Furthermore, if you apply for a job and are invited for an interview,
          keep in mind that there are numerous other candidates who have also
          made it through the last round and are also invited for an interview,
          and that interview will determine who gets the job. So, effectively,
          persons with the same level, degrees, credentials, and accomplishments
          compete for the same post. The one thing that will set you apart or
          make you stand out from the crowd is how well you represent yourself,
          how well you conduct in the interview, and how effectively you present
          yourself. That is where etiquette comes in.
          <br />
          <br />
          To emphasize this point, I’d like to share a quotation from Clarence
          Thomas, a US Supreme Court justice. I’ve included this phrase in my
          book as well since I simply love the message. It states:
          <br />
          <br />
          This is absolutely correct! In today’s society, your impressive
          education, accomplishments, and credentials are unlikely to impress
          many individuals. What really stands out to people nowadays is how
          well-behaved and well-mannered you are. Good etiquette will
          undoubtedly open incredible doors for you. Now, let’s take a look at
          some etiquette guidelines that can help you prepare for a job
          interview.

          <h4> 1. Dress Up</h4>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Dress appropriately for the job you desire, not the job you applied
            for. You must maintain your life aims and goals in mind. Perhaps you
            are unable to obtain the desired position at this time in your life.
            When dressing up, keep in mind your dream and aspiration, which will
            hopefully lead you to the position you so desire over time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Why is it vital to dress appropriately for a job interview?
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy drawing parallels with a superhero putting on his costume.
            The superhero has power, the power that resides inside him. However,
            the suit puts him in the appropriate frame of mind, giving him the
            impression that he can conquer the world and save humanity.
            <br />
            <br />
            The same is true when it comes to dressing for a job interview. So,
            when you put on the appropriate suit or outfit, you have the mindset
            that you are ready to conquer, represent yourself, and achieve your
            goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            What is the right dress code for a job interview?
            <br />
            <br />A job interview requires business attire. Depending on the
            type of company you’re applying to, it could be business casual or
            business formal. To be cautious, if you’re not sure whether it’s
            casual or formal, go with business formal. Because this will ensure
            that you arrive prepared and in the best possible manner.{" "}
          </p>

          <h4>Suit or Outfit </h4>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              For men, that means a well-ironed, well-cared-for dark suit with a
              nicely-dressed T-shirt in white, beige, or light blue, a decent
              tie that complements the suit, and dark formal shoes.
            </li>
            <li>
              For women, this may be a well-ironed, well-cared-for dark-colored
              suit, with pants or a skirt, a lovely shirt, and flats, kitten
              heels, or mid-heels shoes.
            </li>
            <li>
              For both men and women, make careful to avoid using bright colors,
              bold designs, or patterns that will draw the interviewer’s
              attention away from you.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Hair</h4>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              If you have dandruff in your hair, both men and women should get
              rid of it, especially before the job interview. Because dandruff
              will be visible on the shoulders of a dark-colored tube, make sure
              your hair is clean and neat.
            </li>
            <li>For men, make sure that your beard is well-groomed.</li>
            <li>
              Women can wear their hair in a ponytail or a lovely bun. If you
              have shorter hair or prefer to arrange it in a particular way, go
              ahead and do so, but make sure it’s not all over your face so it
              doesn’t distract the interviewer from you and what you’re saying.
              When applying makeup, keep it natural and avoid any brightly
              colored lipsticks or smoky eyes because the job interview will
              take place during the day, so you should dress appropriately.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Nails</h4>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              For men and women, make sure your nails are clean and clipped,
              because the interviewers will be looking at your nails and fingers
              as well as your hands as you speak.
            </li>
            <li>
              For women, when getting your manicure and selecting a nail paint
              color, keep your interview date in mind because you don’t want to
              have bright nail polish or patterns or designs on your nails on
              your interview day. Keep it tidy, ideally short, and limited to
              pastel hues, especially beige, pale pink, or white.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The same is true for your accessories, such as a belt. If you’re
            wearing a belt, make sure it’s not too showy or has a large logo on
            it. Keep things understated and clean.
            <br />
            <br />
            When it comes to characterizing your overall appearance, one term
            that springs to mind is “modest.” Make sure you suit the description
            with anything you wear. As a result, neither too much of your flesh
            nor too many flashing accessories are on you. So, make an effort to
            appear representative, formal, and humble.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>2. Grooming </h4>
          <p>
            This is especially important when it comes to your breath. To avoid
            bad breath, make sure you check it before entering the room. Use
            chewing gums or mints, but make sure to throw them away before
            entering the room because you may have forgotten you have chewing
            gum in your mouth when you enter the room, and while the interviewer
            is asking you questions because you’re nervous, you can mindlessly
            chew the gum, which will distract the interviewer.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, while it’s crucial to have fresh breath, remove any mints or
            chewing gum from your mouth before entering the room.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>3. Be on time: punctuality matters</h4>
          <p>
            Often, people are late because they are unfamiliar with the location
            to which they must report. So, possibly they were unfamiliar with
            the region or neighborhood, or they misidentified the structures.
            <br />
            <br />
            In that instance, my suggestion to all of my students is to set
            aside a day to inspect the venue where your interview will take
            place. Make sure to set aside one day prior to the interview day to
            visit the location where your interview will be held.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, arrange your time, look at the location, perhaps discover the
            proper building, where level it will be held on, and then decide
            which mode of transportation you will use. Is it a bus, a cab, or a
            subway? So that on the day of the interview, you know how many
            minutes or hours you need to budget for transportation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Arriving 10 or more minutes early is also not a good thing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Arriving early puts the interviewer in an uncomfortable position. He
            or she is either going over the remaining things that he or she will
            ask you, or they are interviewing someone else.
            <br />
            <br />
            When the candidates see each other, the interviewers frequently
            dislike it. So, to prevent that awkward circumstance, make sure you
            wait somewhere else. Perhaps there is a coffee shop nearby where you
            can stop and wait for a while before proceeding to your interview
            location and beginning your interview.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>4. Leave your heavy belongings outside</h4>
          <p>
            Tip number four is to leave all heavier items outside. That includes
            your umbrella, perhaps your coat if it’s winter, a big bag that you
            have, and you can ask the assistant to look after your possessions
            while you’re having an interview.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is significant since the seven seconds you spend entering the
            room will have a lasting impact on the interviewer, and you don’t
            want to appear careless and laden with extra items.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>5. Walking confidently</h4>
          <p>
            Walking confidently, check out my videos on how to walk correctly,
            smile, and in good times, extend your hand for a strong handshake.
            In times of COVID, you might wish to skip the step and settle for a
            decent nod and a sincere smile.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>6. Sit when asked to</h4>
          <p>
            Sixth tip: Sit down when motioned to do so. This is significant
            because you should not take your seat unless you have been indicated
            or spoken “please take your seat,” at which point you should take
            your seat, sit comfortably, and maintain a very straight posture.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the most common inquiries that students have is, “What do I
            do with my hands?” You often give away your worry by touching your
            hair, accessorizing, or doing something fidgety with your hands.
            Make sure you keep them on your lap, especially if you’re in the
            United States, or if you’re in Europe, make sure your hands are
            visible by placing your hands by their wrists at the table while
            conversing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>7. Maintain eye contact</h4>
          <p>
            The seventh tip is to keep strong eye contact. This is done to
            develop trust between you and the interviewer. Maintain eye contact
            with the person conducting the interview if there is only one. If
            you’re on a panel, make eye contact with each member on the panel.
            If someone asks you a question, look into their eyes, and then when
            answering, make sure you look in everyone’s eyes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Where should I look, then? The eyes, brows, and forehead are the
            designated areas where you can glance at the face. So, if you’re at
            an interview, be sure to only glance at the interviewer’s eye,
            eyebrows, or forehead because the gaze below that will give off a
            very informal vibe.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>8. Address the interviewer correctly</h4>
          <p>
            If the interviewer introduces themselves again as you arrive and
            adds, “Hi, my name is Jonathan, but you may call me John,” it
            suggests he permits you to address him on a first-name basis. If you
            already know the interviewer’s name. If they don’t grant you
            permission, you should address them formally, using the titles Mr.
            and Mrs. plus their last name.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>9. Be prepared for the small talk.</h4>
          <p>
            Be prepared to participate in small chat. By small talk, I mean
            anything unrelated to your application or your resume. You can be
            questioned by the interviewer about the weather or how your day was.
            Small conversation is an icebreaker that will establish the tone for
            the remainder of the interview, so don’t ignore it. Be cautious,
            mindful, courteous when responding, and interested in small talk.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4> 10. Know your CV/resume by heart</h4>
          <p>
            Know your CV or resume off by heart. What I really mean is that
            since we write our CVs so long ago, we sometimes forget to review
            them before applying for a job. We also frequently neglect to review
            our credentials and accomplishments from the previous ten years. The
            key is to be prepared to explain each of the things listed in your
            CV, so the more organized you are, the better. This involves
            printing out a copy for each interviewer, so be sure to bring your
            own copy with you to the interview and give it to them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>11. Research FAQs for interviews.</h4>
          <p>
            Be ready to debate all different types of questions. The easiest
            approach to get ready is to google the most often asked questions,
            run over them in your head in the days leading up to the interview,
            and then be prepared to answer them when the time comes.
            <br />
            <br />
            “What are your strengths or weaknesses?”, this is probably one of
            the most commonly asked questions by interviewers. Many of us are
            fully aware of our talents; we have listed them in our resumes, and
            they are quite obvious—either we are good with numbers, work well
            with technology, or speak multiple languages—but we frequently
            struggle to articulate our limits.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please refrain from referring to your strength as a limitation when
            answering the question about your limitation because doing so
            suggests that you are not being completely honest and/or that you
            are looking for compliments. Consider carefully what your
            limitations are.
            <br />
            <br />
            Delegating duties to others can be tough for me personally, for
            instance, because I feel untrusting when I let someone else handle
            anything. As a result, I want to supervise everything and, in some
            cases, even micromanage difficult jobs, which doesn’t exactly
            demonstrate that I’m a good manager. This is a weakness of mine, but
            it has the potential to become a strength if I land a particular job
            or work in the proper setting.{" "}
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>12. Research the company.</h4>
          <p>
            Do your homework on the company that you’re applying to. This
            demonstrates your level of professionalism and preparation. As a
            result, when you talk about the company during the interview, you
            are fully aware of the CEO, the markets, and the organization’s
            guiding principles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, when they want you to ask specific questions, you avoid
            asking them things like “Oh, where are the markets located?” or
            “What are the values of the organization?” because they will just
            claim you can find it online. Additionally, it will provide you a
            greater understanding of the business, including where it is
            expanding and whether it is branching out into other markets or
            industries.
            <br />
            <br />
            For instance, if you are aware that the business is looking to
            expand into new markets in Latin America, you could mention that you
            speak Spanish, are knowledgeable about the Latin American market,
            and believe that you could be an asset to the business because you
            can help them learn about the area and possibly spend the winter
            there.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>13. Ask questions.</h4>
          <p>
            When prompted to do so, ask questions. When the interviewer asks,
            “Do you have any questions for us?” at the conclusion of the
            interview. Do not ignore this paragraph or respond “No, I don’t,” as
            doing so implies a lack of interest in the company. Because you’ve
            already done your research and homework on the company, you might
            ask some questions that are more open-ended and evaluative rather
            than about the company’s ideals or the areas it seeks to expand
            into. For instance, questions like “How will my work be evaluated?”
            and “How has your experience working here been?” cannot be answered
            online and demonstrate your interest in the firm as well as your
            curiosity.{" "}

          <h4>14. Thank the interviewer twice.</h4>
          <p>
            Express your gratitude to the interviewer twice. In the good old
            days, it would involve a solid strong handshake and a sincere “thank
            you” at the conclusion of the interview. This is just a simple tip
            of the head and a sincere “thank you for your time” in the COVID
            era.
            <br />
            <br />A day following your interview, you should thank your
            interviewer again. If you know that the hiring decision will be
            decided in two or three days, you might send an email. You may
            choose to send a lovely handwritten thank you note if they need more
            time to decide.{" "}

          <h4>15. Rehearse, Rehearse, Rehearse</h4>
          <p>
            Rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse is my last piece of advice. I
            cannot stress this enough because in, everything we do, the
            performer who has practiced the most is the best performer. Think
            through the questions you might be asked and how you’ll enter the
            room and sit down. The more you practice, the better you’ll be on
            the day of your performance. You can ask your parents or siblings to
            judge it.
            <br />
            <br />I sincerely hope you find these suggestions helpful,
            practical, and applicable to your lives. I wish you success in your
            current positions as well as good luck in all of your upcoming
            ventures, no matter what they may be.
