        <p>
          When asked a person whether you think you’re confident, you would
          usually say yes or no based on your overall impression.
          <br />
          <br />
          The truth is there’s no single factor that makes a person appear
          confident. It is the combination of all three elements: your body,
          mind, and appearance, that sends the message that you are confident.
          <br />
          <br />
          Though some of us are born more confident than others for a variety of
          reasons, including our upbringing, how our parents treated us, and how
          society, school, or people around us treated us. It is true that our
          environment has a significant influence on us, and as a result, our
          confidence levels may differ when we reach adulthood.
          <br />
          <br />
          But the good news is that we can train to boost our confidence level;
          all it takes is a little more practice and knowledge of what to work
          on. Let’s take a closer look at each of these three elements to see
          how they can help you boost your confidence.
        </p>

        <div className="ways">
          <h2> 1. Looks Matter: Like What You See</h2>
          <p>
            {" "}
            I know there’s a lot of debate about whether we should judge a book
            by its cover or if that’s an old archaic notion. However, the truth
            is that the first impression that anyone makes on us is based on
            seven seconds, and that impression is usually strongly influenced by
            the way they look.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’d like to send a different type of message here. I want you to
            look however you want, not how other people would like to see you.
            When you like what you see in the mirror, when you like what you see
            in your own reflection, your confidence level immediately rises.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’d like to use my daughter as an example to make this point. She’s
            only six years old, but when she gets to pick out her outfit for
            school early in the morning and she loves it, she just looks at
            herself in the mirror with admiration. And she feels confident as
            she walks out the door that day.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, when I make her wear something for a specific
            occasion because it’s a dress code or because I think she’ll look
            beautiful in it, but she doesn’t perceive it that way, she wouldn’t
            like it for some reason, and her confidence level suffers as a
            result. She will not admire herself in the mirror, regardless of
            what others around her say about her appearance.
            <br />
            <br />
            At home, try this test for yourself.
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. Assume you’re still in your pajamas. Your hair is all messed
                up. You know you don’t feel very confident in that outfit.
              </li>
              <li>2. Simply go take a shower.</li>
              <li>
                3. Change into a nice pair of jeans, a nice blouse, or a white
                t-shirt quickly.
              </li>
              <li>4. Wear your hair down or in a nice bun.</li>
              <li>5. Apply a little makeup.</li>
              <li>6. If preferred, add some perfume.</li>
            </ul>
            Then go up to the nerve, look in the mirror, and see what will
            happen to your confidence level after you did that. You will notice
            that your confidence level increased from 0 to 100 in less than 20
            to 30 minutes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now that we’ve mastered and grasped the importance of appearances in
            boosting our confidence and the appearances that matter to you that
            you want to see in yourself, we’ll move on to working on our body.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Train your body</h2>
          <p>
            Working on the body takes much longer than adjusting your
            appearance. It is also quite doable and very learnable. There are a
            few universal body language postures that convey confidence.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>– Open Body Posture</h4>
          <p>
            Maintain an open body posture. It implies that you should not slouch
            or cross your arms and that your body should not be obstructed by
            anything. Your body should be open and visible to the person with
            whom you are interacting. I also did a video on how to walk
            elegantly and confidently.{" "}
          </p>

          <h4>– Power Stance</h4>
          <p>
            Strike a power pose in which your feet are slightly greater than
            they would be for a woman. But, in general, the more physical space
            you occupy, the more confident you feel internal, and the more
            confident others perceive you to be.
            <br />
            <br />
            Again, this does not imply that you must take it to its extreme. You
            know that stretching your legs too far apart will not make you
            appear confident. Decency and modesty in everything that you do.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>– Eye Contact</h4>
          <p>
            Maintaining eye contact is extremely important. It is essential to
            look people in the eyes. The more you can maintain eye contact, the
            more people will perceive you to be self-assured. In fact, I’ve
            created two videos on body language tips and tricks. These are
            helpful hints to know if you want to appear competent and
            trustworthy as a negotiator and speaker.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>– Smile More Often</h4>
          <p>
            A universal sign of confidence and friendliness is to smile more
            often. The more you can smile at people, the more they will believe
            you are confident in yourself. You’re approachable. You are so
            confident in yourself that you allow someone else to approach you.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h4>– Mind Your Hands</h4>
          <p>
            Take note of your hands. Even if you don’t say anything, your hands
            will reveal how you truly feel. If you are cracking your knuckles,
            biting your nails, or playing with your ring, it demonstrates a lack
            of confidence.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you’re a lady, a small bag or clutch can come in handy to keep
            your hands occupied. You can simply hold your clutch or bag to take
            up your hands. If you’re out and about socializing, such as at a
            networking event, you could pick up a glass and place it in your
            left hand, occupying your hand and making you feel a little more
            comfortable and confident.
          </p>

        <div className="ways">
          <h2>3. Educate Your Mind </h2>
          <p>
            This is going to take a little bit more time to prepare, and the
            final is the mind. It will take a little bit more time but it’s also
            doable.
            <br />
            <br />
            What I mean by the mind is your knowledge of things. It’s important
            to make sure that you continue educating yourself even after
            graduating from school. The more things you’re aware of, the more
            confident and comfortable you feel in conversation with others.
            <br />
            <br />
            Self-education is a lifelong practice.
            <ul>
              <li>1. Read best-selling books.</li>
              <li>
                2. Keep up with world events and keep yourself well informed.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Learn about the topics that your friends, community,
                university, and society are discussing so that you can
                contribute to the conversation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            When you don’t understand what people are talking about, you tend to
            withdraw from the conversation because you don’t have anything to
            say. And to have something to say, you must be aware of everything
            that is going on. Just a little bit here and there is useful to be
            able to maintain small talk, to keep the conversation going.
            <br />
            <br />
            To demonstrate this point, I’d like to use an example from my own
            experience. When I was in 5th and 6th grade, I was attending an art
            class where my classmates were discussing a new book that I’d never
            heard of, and for the full hour of the class, I felt insecure. I
            felt uncomfortable.
            <br />
            <br />
            To sum it up, I was unable to contribute anything to this
            conversation because I had no idea what they were discussing. Then
            as soon as I got home, I asked my mom to buy the book for me. And I
            believe that many of you from my generation are aware of this. The
            book under discussion was Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, I asked my mother to get me one. She spent the entire evening
            looking for the book, eventually bringing one home. To say the
            least, I was ecstatic when I began reading the book. To cut a long
            story short, for the next few years, all we could talk about was
            Harry Potter, and I was always a part of the conversation.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are sometimes able to find communities that are doing things that
            we already enjoy. So, we join this community of people and feel as
            if we can contribute to the discussion.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, there are times when we need to explore new fields of
            interest, perhaps those that were previously outside of our scope of
            interest, to grow and contribute to more things. This has nothing to
            do with blending.
            <br />
            <br />
            This does not imply that you must sacrifice your own interests for
            the sake of the greater good. It simply means that, in addition to
            your own interests, you begin to develop or explore new
            possibilities, new knowledge, and new fields for yourself, while
            also growing as an individual, and this is part of increasing your
            confidence level.
            <br />
            <br />
            The more you know about your surroundings, the more confident you’ll
            feel in yourself and your ability to participate in discussions and
            communities.
            <ol>
              <li>Start reading more books. </li>
              <li>Begin to listen to more podcasts. </li>
              <li>
                Begin learning about subjects you’ve never wanted to learn
                about.{" "}
              </li>
            </ol>
            It never hurts to have a little bit of knowledge.
            <br />
            <br />
            To summarize, it’s not just about how you look, it’s not just about
            how you walk or talk, and it’s not just about what you have to say;
            it’s a combination of all three elements that makes you feel and
            look confident.
