        <p>
          The front office is the main department in the hotel industry. It’s
          also called the nerve center of a hotel. It is situated in the lobby
          area. This department is located around the main entrance of the hotel
          and is visible easily to the guests, patrons, and visitors.

        <h4>IMPORTANCE OF FRONT OFFICE DEPARTMENT IN HOTEL</h4>

          The front office is the most important department of the hotel
          industry. The staff of this department is very actively looking to the
          guests. In this department, the staff handles all the transactions
          between the hotel and its guests.

          office department for their solutions. This department is a major
          operational and revenue-producing department in the hotel.

          Pre-arrival, Arrival, Occupancy, Departure, and many other services.

          <br />
          It has been said that 75% of a guest’s total satisfaction with a hotel
          is determined during all the front office processes. A successful
          hotel must do whatever it can to ensure that the guest is satisfied
          with every aspect of registration.
          <br />

          The first hotel employees who come into contact with most guests when
          they arrive are members of the uniformed services division of the
          front office.

        <h2>HOTEL FRONT OFFICE MANAGER JOB DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
        In this front office department, operations are visible to the guest of the hotel. Also, the front office manager is responsible for answering all the guest’s questions and handling all the guest’s complaints. The front office is the only department that is responsible for Guests’ Check-in, Checkout, Reservation, Registration, Arrival, Pre-arrival, etc.
<br /><br />
Analysis of the registration process begins with a look at the arrival chronology. Arrival chronology is the term used to categorize the stages a transient or group guest goes through upon arrival at a hotel. The arrival chronology allows for analysis of the front office departments that come into contact with the hotel guest.
<br /><br />
The front office person greets every hotel guest. The first impression is very important. So, they always keep an eye on total guest satisfaction, the initial greeting begins the process of establishing a favorable impression of the hotel.
<br /><br />
The most widely recognized job role within the industry is the bell person or bell boy, who is responsible for the assistance of guests to their rooms and explaining the hotel and hotel features to each and every guest.
<br /><br />
Once a guest has arrived and has made it to the front desk, the registration process begins. It is at this point that most guests have begun to create an impression of the hotel in their minds.
<br /><br />
The front office department must continue to focus on guest satisfaction. Hotels that create a warm and inviting atmosphere around the front office area ensure that the registration process goes smoothly.
<br /><br />
Getting people into guest rooms quickly, efficiently, and accurately is the primary responsibility of the front desk. Checking guests entails processing individual reservations, assigning the proper guest rooms by ensuring that room preferences are maintained, and obtaining the method of payment.
<br /><br />
The front office department has the very first and probably the most important/crucial opportunity to make an impression on the guest’s stay. Sometimes this department has more of an impact than any other employee with whom the guest might come into contact at the hotel. The front office person is the first person who meets the guests when they arrive and one of the last people who says a goodbye to the guests as they depart.
