        <h4>10 Most Common Etiquette Mistakes</h4>
        <p>
          Etiquette is important, and many people make etiquette mistakes
          unconsciously. Here are a few of the most common etiquette mistakes.
        </p>
        <div className="ways">
          <h4> 1. Not thanking the gift giver on time</h4>
          <p>
            Many people are guilty of this, and they frequently forget to thank
            the giver on time, or even at all. Even if you haven’t had a chance
            to open the gift and see what’s inside, it’s essential to express
            gratitude as soon as you receive the gift.
            <br />
            <br />
            You must thank the giver and inform them that the gift has arrived.
            Once you’ve unpacked the gift, send another message to express your
            appreciation for the gift and highlight the positive sides of it, as
            well as how considerate the gift giver was to offer it to you.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Responding “No problem” to “Thank you”</h4>
          <p>
            This is a common error made by many people. To react to a “Thank
            you” with a “No problem” is something we’ve recently added into our
            daily lingo. With this, you’re implying that whatever the person has
            requested you to do was a burden, a problem. So now you’re admitting
            that it’s not a problem for you. It used to be as simple as “You’re
            welcome” or “It’s my pleasure”, which is the proper way to respond.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>3. Greeting people you don’t know with “Hey”</h4>
          <p>
            I’ve seen this done on the streets, in messages, in emails, and even
            on social media platforms. But you must always address someone you
            don’t know for the first time or someone older than you with a ‘Hi’
            or ‘Hello.’ Do not use the word ‘Hey,’ it is inappropriate for
            someone who is older or for someone you do not know personally.{" "}

            4. Man extending hand first to handshake woman in a social setting
          </h4>
          <p>
            In a social setting, females are always prioritized, so women have
            more authority to decide where to sit, get the best view, and decide
            whether to handshake a man. Always wait for a woman to extend her
            hand first. If a man does not do so and extends his hand first to a
            woman:
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
              <li>
                She may not respond at all. And the man’s hand will be just
                hanging there, which will not make him feel at ease.
              </li>
              <li>
                He will put the woman in an awkward situation in which she has
                to respond but isn’t particularly eager to do so.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Gender, on the other hand, plays no role in business etiquette. It
            is your rank, your position, that will determine who needs to extend
            the hand to whom first.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>5. Sneezing in your right-hand palm</h4>
          <p>
            It’s not right, it’s impolite, and it’s not hygienic to sneeze just
            like that. Because we usually extend our right hand for a handshake.
            As a result, the chances of you passing on your germs to someone
            else are much higher. When you need to sneeze, you can either sneeze
            into your elbow or use the left upper palm of your hand. Turn your
            head away from the person you’re talking to, simply apologize and
            cover your mouth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>6. Pointing at people with fingers</h4>
          <p>
            Let’s say you’re in a meeting and you need to say “She raised this
            point.” and you’re just pointing at her. It is considered impolite
            in many cultures to point at people with your fingers, so instead,
            use your full hand to gesture towards the person.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>7. Mispronouncing or misspelling someone’s name</h4>
          <p>
            This appears to be very obvious, and why would anyone misspell or
            mispronounce someone’s name when they can see it? I tend to receive
            lots of emails in which people misspell my name, and address me as
            either Jammy or Jamelia, or people see how I sign off my name in an
            email and still address me incorrectly.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is quite disrespectful to the person to whom you’re speaking
            and might cause them to not take the email seriously. Always
            double-check that you’re spelling their name correctly and
            capitalizing the initial letter when writing. When you’re addressing
            someone in person, make sure you pronounce it properly. If you don’t
            know how to say it, it’s acceptable to ask “Could you teach me how
            to pronounce your name correctly?” And I can promise you that the
            person would prefer you to ask that rather than using a false or
            mispronounced name throughout the conversation.{" "}

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>8. Placing utensils on the table after using them</h4>
          <p>
            Once you’ve taken up your utensils and eaten anything, you can never
            put them back on the tablecloth. If you’re taking a break, you’ll
            need to make sure that they stay on your plate. The knife and fork
            go either straight up and down in the centre of the plate with the
            handles resting on the rim, or pointing between 10 and 4 o’clock. In
            each case the tines of the fork should be facing up, and the knife
            edge pointing in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>9. Confusing the drinking glasses</h4>
          <p>
            Picking up the wrong glass is a common etiquette mistake. I’ve seen
            this done numerous times at various parties and birthday
            celebrations, where individuals are confused after they’ve stood up,
            danced, returned to their seats, and are concerned as to which of
            these two glasses is actually theirs.
            <br />
            <br />
            In order to avoid any confusion, keep this rule in mind. Form a
            circle using both hands. Your left hand will represent the letter B
            which corresponds to bread and butter, while your right hand will
            represent the letter D which corresponds to your drinks.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once you’ve mentally completed this image, you’ll know that the
            letter D which corresponds to your drinks, actually refers to your
            drink glasses. Everything you’re drinking will be placed on the
            right side of the plate.

          <h4>10. Sticking a pinkie out when holding a teacup</h4>
          <p>
            The proper way to hold the teacup is to pinch your index and thumb
            through the handle and then use your middle finger as a support for
            the cup handle. Then your ring finger and pinky are tucked inwards,
            so you can hold the teacup without having to extend your pinky.
          </p>
