        <h2>How To Be A Good Speaker, By Ms. Anukriti Sharma</h2>
        <hr />

        <img src={im1} alt="" srcset="" />
        <p>
          I previously failed a voice test. I was the only one in class who did
          not pass, so I was told to speak louder. I was unable to project my
          voice when asked to do so, so I failed to meet the required threshold.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the end of the day, I obtained a very good grade in the class,
          owing primarily to my presentation skills and the manner in which I
          present information. But I performed poorly on the voice test. I had
          to spend extra time with a special voice coach who massaged my larynx,
          made me speak in very crowded places, and made me project my voice
          much louder, which I couldn’t do before.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a teacher, I am required to speak frequently. I occasionally give
          personal or public workshops in front of large groups of people. I
          must project my voice. Because of the physical characteristics of my
          vocal cords, it is extremely difficult for me. However, it is a work
          in progress. During my work experience, I was able to gather certain
          tips that I would like to share with you in the hopes of assisting you
          in becoming the best speaker you can possibly be.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you watch some of my vlogs, you’ll see some humorous jokes about it
          being an unintentional ASMR video. Many people all over the world are
          extremely sensitive to sound.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sound can help us distinguish between people who are amicable,
          credible, gentle, soft, and kind. Those are the characteristics we
          seek in humans, and we are more likely to be drawn to those who
          possess them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some students may drop the class because the professor spoke too
          loudly, too quickly, or because the pitch of his voice was either too
          low or too high, irritating their ears and causing them not to
          understand the lesson.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, there are some that even if you can’t see them, you can fall
          in love with how they sound. There are true-to-life stories about
          people who fall in love on the phone while talking to each other, and
          they fall in love with the person’s voice before even seeing them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Speaking is essential no matter what your job or profession is.
          Whether it’s representing your client in court, explaining something
          to a patient, discussing topics with your students, passing a job
          interview, or marketing a product in the market.
          <br />
          <br />
          Other professionals, such as politicians, hire voice coaches or
          speaking trainers to help them develop a speaking style that makes
          them appear credible, amicable, and likable to voters.
          <br />
          <br />
          Interestingly, Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister in the 1970s, had a
          voice coach because her very high-pitched voice was unpopular with
          voters. It made her sound insecure and untrustworthy, so the voice
          coach had to lower her pitch by working on the tone of her voice to
          help her alternate the tone of her speaking manner, making her sound
          more interesting to her electors.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some people have even undergone vocal cord surgery in order to change
          the pitch of their voices. So politicians understand the importance of
          public speaking, and we understand the importance of public speaking
          in all professions.
        </p>
        <h2>Element #1: PITCH – Rate of Vibration</h2>
        <p>
          The pitch of our voice is determined by the rate of vibrations
          produced by the vocal cords, which range from high to low. Because of
          the hormones testosterone and estrogen, which influence the growth and
          structure of our vocal cords, men typically have lower-pitched voices
          and women have higher-pitched voices.
          <br />
          <br />
          The pitch of our voice is determined by the structure of our vocal
          cords, which we are born with. Of course, some people have had plastic
          surgery to change the pitch of their voice dramatically. However, you
          can vary your voice within the same range by researching specific
          exercises, such as going from super high pitched to lowering it
          slightly, without undergoing surgery.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Element #2: VOLUME – Level of the Voice</h2>
        <p>
          Volume refers to the speaker’s voice level, which can range from quiet
          to loud.{" "}
        </p>
       
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Because of the structure of their larynx and the size of their lungs,
          men generally have louder voices. The larger your larynx and lungs,
          the louder your voice. Women, on the other hand, speak more quietly.
          <br />
          <br /> People with louder voices are more outgoing and confident,
          while those with quieter voices are shyer. Although this is a
          stereotype, it is true in some ways.
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural Upbringing</h2>
        <p>
          Aside from our physical characteristics, the cultural upbringing in
          which we were born influences the volume of our voice. Our voice level
          is also affected by our age and hearing ability. People in Africa
          speak louder than people in Asia due to cultural differences. I’m
          getting emails from people saying, “Oh, you know, I speak so loudly
          that I feel obnoxious around other people. How can you assist me in
          becoming quieter?”. We must be aware of our natural volume, which is
          the volume of your voice when you are alone, talking to a family
          member, or singing a song.
          <br />
          <br />
          Examine yourself from the side to see how you sound in a social
          setting or social gathering. You tend to lower your voice because you
          are uncomfortable or shy, or you may raise your voice because you want
          to be noticed, heard, or appear more outgoing.
          <br />
          <br />
          This will assist us in determining what factors influence the volume
          of your voice. Make certain that when you select a volume, it works to
          your advantage, assisting you in your social or professional life. You
          can also practice techniques to change the volume of your voice.
        </p>

        <h2>Element #3: TONE – Rhythm or Pace of the Voice</h2>
        <p>
          
          The tone is a vital component of your voice that refers to the rhythm
          and pace of your speaking style. You can change it up to make it sound
          more interesting. We can characterize a tone as friendly or
          unfriendly, dominant or assertive, persuasive, or sarcastic.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are several ways to interpret tone depending on how we hear it
          from the person speaking to us. Whatever the situation, keep your tone
          under control, even if the message is different.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’re in a hostile environment or someone asks you in an impolite
          way, keep your tone friendly but send the message. You may object that
          this is not the proper way to address me. This implies that you do not
          want them to do it or that you do not agree with what they are doing,
          but by using a friendly tone, you create the right environment for
          your message. When it comes to public speaking, we always associate
          monotone with something negative or boring. If someone’s presentation
          or speaking skills are monotone, it means they speak at the same tone
          level all the time. As a result, the pace of their speech remains
          constant. They don’t change it, and as a result, the audience is
          bored. It is critical to maintain that change in the proper manner so
          that your audience will listen and remain engaged. They will also
          recognize when there is an emphasis or when the message is important
          by using tone and enunciation. The tone of your speech, like salt and
          pepper to a dish, adds flavor and extra flavor to your speech and your
          speaking style. So, in order to make your speech more interesting,
          work on its tone and rhythm.{" "}
        </p>
      
        <h2>Tip #1: BREATHING: DIAPHRAGMATIC</h2>
        <p>
          Breathing is important because the air we breathe causes our vocal
          cords to vibrate and produce sound. We will essentially make no sound
          if there is no air. Exhale all of the air from your lungs and try to
          say a long sentence as an exercise.
          <br />
          <br />
          Examine how much you can say or how your voice sounds. Then take a
          deep breath and repeat the sentence. When you exhale and have no air
          in your lungs, you can barely finish a sentence, whereas when your
          lungs are full of air, you can sound more confident and speak more
          easily.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another reason we don’t sound the way we want to, especially when
          we’re nervous, is that we run out of air. In this case, take a moment
          to inhale and fill your lungs with air before continuing with your
          message.
          <br />
          <br />A breathing technique that many public speakers teach is
          diaphragmatic breathing, which is done before giving a speech. You
          must place one hand on your chest and the other below your rib cage.
          When you breathe, your chest remains stable, but you must feel the
          diaphragm expand and contract. When you breathe this way, you ensure
          that the air flows smoothly and that you can speak as clearly as
          possible.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Tip #2: TAKE PAUSES</h2>
        <p>
          These are necessary for a speech and to improve the clarity of your
          words. They pique your listener’s interest in your message. Words
          spoken after silence are far more powerful.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pauses function similarly to full stops in a speech, or even as a
          separate paragraph that assists the listener in breaking down your
          message into smaller parts. You must be able to use them to emphasize
          specific ideas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pauses are sometimes used on purpose to make it appear as if they are
          reflecting and to make their message sound stronger. It is critical to
          vary the speed of your speech in order to avoid sounding anxious or
          nervous.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you speak too quickly, the receivers will not understand. Slowly
          speaking, on the other hand, will bore your audience. Changing the
          speed of your speech makes it more interesting and engaging to your
          audience.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Tip #3: HAVE A STRAIGHT POSTURE</h2>
        <p>
          Posture allows air to easily enter your vocal cords, allowing you to
          vibrate more smoothly. If you slouch or are in an uncomfortable
          position that prevents air from entering, you will not sound as good
          because you will not have enough air.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Tip #4: DRINK WATER</h2>
        <p>
          The ability to drink water hydrates the vocal cords, allowing them to
          vibrate smoothly. Instead of drinking all at once, take small sips
          every time before your presentation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Tip #5: RAISE YOUR VOICE WHEN NECESSARY</h2>
        <p>
          Although speaking loudly can make it easier for others to hear us, it
          can also be used to project our voice to a larger audience. If you
          want to attract people’s attention, lower your voice rather than
          raising it. This makes the room quieter, which causes people to relax
          and pay attention to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you’ve ever heard the power of a whisperer, you’ll know that they
          speak more quietly, drawing attention to the message they’re trying to
          deliver. You must distinguish between speaking loudly to be heard and
          speaking loudly to project your voice to those seated far away. Lower
          your voice if you want to attract attention. Raise your voice if you
          want to be heard by those who are far away.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Tip #6: ENUNCIATION IS IMPORTANT</h2>
        <p>
          This entails highlighting the letters in your words. It differs from
          pronunciation in that it focuses on phonetics, or how certain letters
          sound together and may contain errors due to the fact that it is not
          your native language, causing difficulties in pronouncing certain
          words.
          <br />
          <br />
          Enunciation is different because this is how you speak out those
          letters, such as when you slur words or drop certain letters, which
          are enunciation errors. In the word doing, for example, we must
          pronounce the letter g at the end of the word. Saying it as doing will
          make it sound bad, and listeners will grow tired of hearing it that
          way. You must ensure that the letters are correctly pronounced and
          that no letters are dropped. You must emphasize the words without
          slurring or switching them.
        </p>
        <h2>Tip #7: RECORD YOURSELF SPEAKING</h2>

        <p>
          I recommend filming yourself while speaking so you can see how you
          look and hear how you sound together. If you don’t want to be
          distracted by your own image, use voice memos to listen to how you
          sound and focus on your speaking style. Taping yourself is a lifelong
          endeavor. It’s the formation of your speaking style, so you must
          constantly film and observe yourself from the sidelines, working on
          specific things you want to improve.
