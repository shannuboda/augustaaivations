        <h2>The Corporate HandShake, By Ms. Anukriti Sharma</h2>

        <hr />

        <img src={im1} alt="" srcset="" />
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>
          Before we go into the specifics of the correct and improper
          handshakes, let’s look at their history. Handshakes with other people
          date back to the 5th century BC in Greece. Soldiers used to greet each
          other in this manner to see if the other person was carrying any
          weapons or not.
          <br />
          <br />
          It implies that they’re coming to welcome each other unarmed, with no
          knife or weapon in their arms, and they are making the gesture of
          shaking hands with the other person to signify peace and harmony.
          <br />
          <br />
          Though the concept of assessing if the other person has a weapon has
          evolved over time. The handshaking motion indicates that we are
          working to build a connection and rapport with the person we are
          meeting for the first time or perhaps we’re meeting repeatedly.
        </p>

        <h4>BAD HANDSHAKES</h4>
        <hr />
        <div className="ways">
          <h4> 1. FINGERELLA</h4>
          <p>
            Fingerella is the name given to the first handshake. As the name
            implies, this type of handshake just involves fingers. When you
            extend a portion of your hand to shake hands with someone, they will
            extend their fingers rather than their complete hand.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, women are worse at it, either because they are shy
            and don’t want to go for a handshake, or because they stretch their
            fingers for a hand kiss and the man doesn’t understand and instead
            gives them a handshake. In any case, if you’re guilty of the
            fingerella handshake, try to stop doing it. If you want to shake
            hands, you should extend your entire hand rather than just your
            fingers. Try it at home by asking your sibling, partner, or friend
            to shake your hand using their fingers instead of their hand. And
            once you’ve given them a handshake or a finger shake, consider what
            type of impact you made on them.
            <br />
            <br />
            What would you say to someone who just gave their fingers in a
            handshake? You’d probably use adjectives like timid, untrustworthy,
            and possibly not confident, which are qualities you don’t want to be
            associated with. So, if you want to make a strong, confident
            impression on someone, offer your entire hand rather than just your
            fingers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>2. WET HANDSHAKE</h4>
          <p>
            The wet handshake is the second unappealing handshake. As the name
            implies, this is what happens when you shake someone’s hand while
            their palms are wet.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are a few tips to avoid this type of a handshake.
            <br />
            <br />
            If this is due to a hereditary predisposition, medical therapy, such
            as buttocks into your hands, may be able to help you overcome the
            problem. However, you should consult your doctor. You could use baby
            powder. Dust it lightly within your palms. Using makeup wipes is a
            good option. You might also use those wipes to blot the inside of
            your palms, so they aren’t damp before you give your hand for a
            handshake, especially if you have oily skin. Another old trick is to
            have a handkerchief with you so you may gently pat it on the insides
            of your palms to make them drier when you extend your hands for a
            handshake. Another reason for a wet handshake is that you’ve most
            likely been holding a glass of cold champagne or wine in your right
            hand. When you’re out and about at a social networking event, and
            you’re offered glasses of alcoholic or non-alcoholic cold drinks,
            you’re holding one.
            <br />
            <br />
            And when it comes time to shake hands, your hand is damp from the
            glass. In that case, I would recommend always holding the glass in
            your left hand so that your right hand is always dry and ready to be
            offered for a proper handshake. Even if you have developed the
            technique of a perfect handshake, if your palms were wet when you
            extended your hand to someone else, I guarantee you that the
            lingering aftertaste of your handshake will be unpleasant.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>3. BONE CRUSHER</h4>
          <p>
            The third bad handshake is known as a bone crusher. Again, as the
            name implies, this type of handshake attempts to demonstrate that
            they have a firm handshake when, in fact, they do not. It’s only
            trying to break your bones. It’s painful. That handshake is so
            unpleasant that you want to get rid of it as soon as possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you know someone who does that, I’m sure you don’t have a good
            feeling about them. And if you are guilty of doing so, try to avoid
            it.
            <br />
            <br />
            When trying to gain power, avoid causing harm to others’ hands. A
            firm, engaged handshake, rather than one that crushes other people’s
            bones, establishes power. Also, for women, especially those who
            enjoy wearing large rings, when you’re out and about to meet someone
            or greet someone you know, you’ll be offering your hand for a
            handshake frequently. Make sure you don’t have any heavy rings on
            your right hand. Change it to the left hand so that the rings on the
            right are more delicate. So that when you shake someone’s hand, you
            don’t hurt it. If you’re a Bonecrusher or know someone who does the
            bone crush handshake, you should know that they’re never the most
            powerful. They’re the ones who want to appear to be.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>4. DEAD FISH</h4>
          <p>
            The dead fish is the term given to the fourth bad handshake. As the
            term suggests, that means inactive or not engaged. The other person
            who offered you their hand in a dead fish manner is when they offer
            their hand, and it is not engaged in a handshaking process. So,
            they’re offering their hand to be shaken rather than shaking yours.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, when someone offers you dead fish, you may have the impression
            that person lacks initiation skills, lacks leadership skills, is not
            very proactive, and does not take initiative.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s not a pleasant sensation, so if you’re guilty of doing dead
            fish, try to engage your hand in the handshake. Do not simply extend
            your hand for a handshake. Shake the other person’s hand as well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>5. BENT-ARM PULL IN</h4>
          <p>
            The fifth bad handshake is known as a bent arm pull-in. This is the
            type of gesture that President Donald Trump has made with other
            world leaders on numerous occasions, and I assure you that it did
            not make them feel at ease.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is when the person greets you, shakes your hand, and then pulls
            your arm closer to them. Some people in certain cultures despise
            closeness. Keep in mind that they have more personal space. When
            greeting someone with a handshake, you must maintain the proper
            distance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>6. AGGRESSIVE PUMPER</h4>
          <p>
            The sixth poor handshake is called an aggressive pumper. As the name
            implies, it’s understandable that the person greeting you with a
            handshake is holding your hand for an extended period and pumping it
            very forcefully up and down.
            <br />
            <br />
            Again, President Donald Trump was guilty of this, and he has made
            many world leaders uncomfortable as a result. You can see a video of
            President Donald Trump greeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
            That put him in a very awkward position.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, when greeting people from other cultures, remember that not
            everyone enjoys prolonged physical contact.

        <h2>PERFECT HANDSHAKE</h2>
        <div className="ways">
          <h4> 1. WRAP FINGERS</h4>
          <p>
            When you do a handshake, you extend your hands straight in a line
            parallel to your natural body line. Then, make sure your fingers are
            wrapped around the hand of the person you’re greeting. This process
            involves your fingers as well
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>2. WEB TO WEB</h4>
          <p>
            Number two rule. When you go for a handshake, make sure that the web
            of your hand touches the web of the other person’s hand so that you
            can feel the connection. This will help you in establishing a more
            rapid or otherwise trustworthy relationship with the other person.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>3. FIRM GRIP</h4>
          <p>
            Make sure to shake the hand firmly now that your hands are
            connected, web to web fingers wrapped around the other hand. Firmly
            implies that you must feel the other person’s hand in yours and
            actively participate in the handshake. You do not simply extend your
            hand to be shaken, nor do you attempt to bone crush the other
            person’s hand.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>4. ELBOWS AT 90 DEGREES</h4>
          <p>
            The fourth rule is that your elbow should be at 90 degrees, but this
            can vary depending on the situation.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you’re standing up to meet someone who is seated, or if you’re
            seated but can’t get up for some reason, you’re meeting someone who
            is standing, this trajectory can change.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, when both of you are standing, your elbows should be at 90
            degrees.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>5. 3-5 PUMPS</h4>
          <p>
            Remember the intense pumper who would pump it for hours on end? The
            general rule for a proper handshake, in this case, is 3 to 5 pumps.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you do less than three pumps, it may appear that you are shy,
            insecure, and untrustworthy because you are attempting to avoid the
            handshake as soon as possible. However, if you extend the handshake
            for more than five pumps in an aggressive manner, it may indicate
            that you are attempting to establish dominance, that you are being
            aggressive, and that you are possibly being pushy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="ways">
          <h4>6. “UP AND DOWN” MOTION</h4>
          <p>
            The sixth rule for a perfect handshake is that it should be done in
            an up and down motion. It shouldn’t be side to side. It’s not moving
            in a wavelike fashion. Keep in mind that you must pump your hand up
            and down.
          </p>
