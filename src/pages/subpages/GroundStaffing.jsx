        <h2>AUGUSTA certified Ground Staff professionals</h2>
        <p>
          We all are mesmerized by the glamorous lives of Pilots and Cabin
          crews. They take care of us during our journey on the flight. But a
          more prominent role is played by ground staff professionals in making
          our journey comfortable. From the moment we enter the airport, to
          checking in, boarding, and disembarking the plane and getting our
          luggage – ground staff are there at our beck and call to assist us in
          our journey. Ground staff role is quite challenging as one requires
          efficient managerial skills as well as quick thinking to manage
          customers before and after the flights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aspiring ground staffers need to be friendly, calm, and emphatic
          towards customers’ problems. They should be prepared to deal with
          different passengers with a smile, while always being ready to help
          travellers in need. As part of their role, they are required to solve
          the passengers’ queries, provide flight information, and ensure a
          trouble-free flight journey. Ground staffs form the backbone of the
          aviation industry. While computers and modernization can streamline
          various processes, the task performed by ground staff cannot be
          replicated by any machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the increase in air travellers and the opening of newer airports,
          the demand for efficient ground staff is also rising.{" "}
