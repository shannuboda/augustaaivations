        <h2>How To Be A Good Listener, By Ms. Anukriti Sharma</h2>
        <hr />

        <img src={im1} alt="" srcset="" />
        <p>
          I believe that being a good listener is a crucial element in becoming
          a good conversationalist.
          <br />
          <br />
          Listening and actively listening are abilities that we all need to
          learn. Consider a world in which people not only listen physically
          (the sound enters their ears) but also hear each other to understand
          what the other person is saying. That would be a great world in which
          everyone is an attentive listener.
          <br />
          <br />
          Why does being a good listener an important element in being a good
          conversationalist?
          <br />
          <br />
          I will answer it with a quote by Maya Angelou, I think she puts it
          perfectly well when she said:
          <br />
          <br />
          This statement is a wonderful example of why you must be a good
          listener. By being a good listener, you make the other person feel
          good about themselves, you allow them to speak up, you listen to them,
          and you care about them.
          <br />
          <br />
          That is why, throughout a conversation, it is more vital to listen
          than to speak. So what essentially happens when you’re an active
          listener, is your conversation just flows because you’re able to
          interact with the other person with a kind of discourse that’s
          authentic, sincere, and shows that you care. They’ll never forget how
          they felt in your presence, and they’ll always say they had a
          wonderful talk with you. I’d want to point out that the majority of
          these suggestions can be applied in both in-person and over-the-phone
          talks. Not all, but the majority, can be utilized.

        <div className="ways">
          <h2>There are two components to being a good listener.</h2>
          <h2> 1. Non-Verbal Signs </h2>
          <p>
            {" "}
            <strong>Tip #1: SMILE</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Remember that when you’re in a business meeting or a conference,
            you’re more likely to approach someone who smiles at you. Because a
            smile indicates to the other person that you welcome them into your
            world. It puts the person at ease, it welcomes them, and it makes
            you look more amicable, and approachable which is a great thing if
            you want to meet more people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Again, be aware when you are smiling throughout the conversation
            because it may not be suitable at times, or it may appear that you
            are faking it. So, smile, especially at the start, but use it
            sparingly during the conversation.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Tip #2: EYE CONTACT</strong>
            <br /><br />
            This demonstrates that you are giving someone your undivided
            attention, that you are present and looking into their soul – into
            their story. We say that our eyes are the windows to our soul, and
            it’s true. We prefer to glance away from something when we are
            hiding or are uninterested.
            <br />
            <br />
            So when you are listening, make sure that you maintain eye contact
            but do so moderately so that you don’t put tension on the person
            you’re having a conversation with.
            <br />
            <br />
            When they’re telling you their story, they can feel uncomfortable if
            you just stare at them. Look aside for a moment to their cheek,
            lips, or forehead, then back into their eyes.
            <br />
            <br />
            If staring into someone’s eyes makes you feel awkward, either
            because you are shy or because you were raised in a culture where
            looking into someone’s eyes was frowned upon, I recommend gazing in
            between the brows, near the top of the nasal bridge. If you stare in
            there, it may appear that you are looking into their eyes, but you
            are not. This provides the idea that you’re looking them in the
            eyes.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Tip #3: OPEN POSTURES</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Your bodily movements are important. Primarily, if you want to
            appear to be an engaged listener, make an effort to become closer to
            the person you’re listening to. Lean in and bring your body closer
            together. Demonstrate that you are not only cognitively but also
            physically present.
            <br />
            <br />
            The location of your head is another key aspect of posture. If you
            tilt your head back and slant it to the side, it may appear like
            you’re bored and uninterested in what they’re saying. So you
            maintain your slanted head position while moving in closer. This
            physically puts your ear closer to the individual, indicating that
            you are listening and hearing what they are saying.
            <br />
            <br />
            Maintain an open body position and avoid crossing your hands or
            closing yourself off from the person you’re talking to or listening
            to. Because doing so physically separates you from the other person.
            Make sure your hands and chest are open, and that you are open to
            their story.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another option is to rest your head on your hand. As a result, you
            should appear more calm and ready to hear and all accessible to
            truly listen to them, your thoughts are engaged in what the person
            is saying.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Tip #4: NOD</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Depending on the message you’re hearing, move your head up and down
            or side to side.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, if someone claims they feel undervalued at work and are
            not driven, this is unfair and unjust. You might repeatedly move
            your head from side to side, as if to say, “I hear what you mean,
            this is so unfair and wrong.”
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, if they claim they’re really excited and have an
            opportunity at work. You can move your head up and down as if to
            say, “Yes, I agree with you.” Nodding or moving your head from side
            to side may represent the messages you’re receiving.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Tip #5: MIRRORING</strong>
            <br /><br />
            It reflects the individual’s body posture or position. This is vital
            not only when speaking, but also when listening.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, someone is telling you a story and gradually and
            steadily leaning in. If they are crossing their arms for any reason,
            slowly and steadily adjust that to your own body language. This
            establishes a kind of rapport between you and the other person.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Verbal Signs</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s look at some of the things we can do verbally, in order to
            reinforce the image of a good listener.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Tip #1. POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT WORDS.</h4>
          <p>
            “Yes.” “Right.” “I hear you.” “I feel you.”
            <br />
            <br />
            These words help the person think that you are listening to him and
            understand what he is saying. It’s critical that you make the person
            feel heard. When having an in-person chat, use it sparingly with
            body language strategies such as nodding. You can switch between the
            two so that your words do not constantly interrupt the speaker.
            <br />
            <br />
            When speaking on the phone, I suggest using more positive
            reinforcement words because they can’t see you or nod, so you can
            use a few more words like these.
          </p>

          <h4>Tip #2. QUESTIONING</h4>
          <p>
            This means follow-up questions to the story they’re sharing. Be
            cautious when questioning the person because you don’t want to ask
            too intimate questions or appear to be interfering with their story.
            You can ask for clarification on particular things that were
            discussed, therefore you may ask a follow-up question.
            <br />
            <br />
            You don’t have to interrogate them and flood them with interview
            questions.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>Tip #3. REFLECTION</h4>
          <p>
            Repeating and paraphrasing what the speaker says to demonstrate that
            you heard and comprehended what they said. This demonstrates that
            you are paying attention and taking in their story.
            <br />
            <br />
            What you’re doing is reflecting their story, giving them the
            impression that you heard and felt their feelings, and demonstrating
            that you’re observing, processing, and reflecting their message back
            to them.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>Tip #4. CLARIFICATION</h4>
          <p>
            Clarify certain points by asking open-ended questions which are not
            answerable by yes or no.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h4>Tip #5. SUMMARIZATION</h4>
          <p>
            Provide a summary of what you’ve been told in your own words. Add a
            question at the end to show that you genuinely listened to what they
            said and to move the conversation ahead.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Tip #6. LISTEN TO THE TONE OF THE VOICE</h4>
          <p>
            The tone conveys more information than the words. We can sometimes
            learn our topic and speech, but it’s difficult to control our tone.
            So, if you can tune in to the speaker’s tone of voice, you can learn
            a lot more than just the speech.
            <br />
            <br />
            All of these are significant. Overall, these will help you become a
            better listener. These methods and tips, though, may overwhelm you.
            But don’t think you have to practice all of these things at once to
            become a good listener.
            <br />
            <br />
            Alternate between a few of these tips, focusing on what seems most
            organic or natural to you. I guarantee you that this will become a
            habit for you with time. An intriguing study in psychology concluded
            that people most commonly like conversations while they are talking
            because people prefer to hear their own voices and to be heard. So,
            if you want to be a good conversationalist, learn to listen well.
